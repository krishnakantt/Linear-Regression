# 📈 Linear Regression using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a simple and effective implementation of **Linear Regression**, a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for predicting continuous values. It showcases the full pipeline from loading the data to training the model and evaluating its performance.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Simple implementation of Linear Regression using **Scikit-learn**
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Model training and prediction
- Evaluation using metrics like **Mean Squared Error** and **R² Score**
- Data visualization using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

- **Linear Regression**: A supervised learning algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a simple and clean CSV file named Salary_Data.csv containing 30 records. It is ideal for performing simple linear regression.

### 🔶 Columns:
- YearsExperience (float): Represents the number of years an individual has worked.
- Salary (float): The corresponding annual salary in USD.
